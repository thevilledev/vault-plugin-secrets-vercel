# Development setup

**NOTE: This setup is purely for local development, demonstration or testing.**

## Run it locally

Run a local development setup with the following commands:

```
$ make build
$ make start
$ make enable
```

This creates a local Vault installation in development mode and enables the plugin.

## Configuring the plugin

Follow [the configuration guide](configuration.md).
